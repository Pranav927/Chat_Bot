# Chat_Bot
The project, a sophisticated chatbot powered by the OpenAI API and text recognition from the Langchain library, revolutionizes the way users interact with textual content. Leveraging state-of-the-art natural language processing capabilities, our chatbot learns from two input text articles provided by the user. By creating vector embeddings of the articles and user questions, it adeptly identifies relevant information and generates accurate responses to user queries related to the articles. Seamlessly integrating advanced AI techniques, the chatbot offers a seamless and intuitive experience for accessing and understanding textual information, making it an invaluable tool for a wide range of applications, from research and education to customer support and beyond. Additionally, I have utilized Streamlit to develop a user-friendly interface, allowing users to interact with the chatbot effortlessly.
